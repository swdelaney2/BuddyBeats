# User stories
 * **Celine:** Celine's wedding is coming up and she wants a way to gather input from her friends about the music she should play at her wedding. She wants to make sure everyone has a good time and gets a special moment during the reception. On her invitation, she includes a bit.ly link for her playlist, so everyone can add two songs. Before the reception, she e-mails the playlist to the DJ so she can coordinate and after the wedding, she savors that the playlist will always be a little time capsule.

 * **Chad:** Chad is totally bumped about this week's rager, brah. But some of the crew is sick of hearing Calvin Harris and Chainsmokers every other song, so he is sending a link around and based on what everyone says, maybe he will add some David Guetta.
