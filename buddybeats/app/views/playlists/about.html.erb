<h1>About BuddyBeats</h1>
<p>Welcome! BuddyBeats is <em>the</em> site to help you make YouTube playlists with your friends. It's helpful for everything from deciding on the music at your wedding to ensuring crowd-pleasing bangers at your next party.</p>

<p>To get started, try <a href=/playlists/new>creating a new playlist</a>. From there, you can decide if it is public (accessible by anyone who visits BuddyBeats) or private (where you can share the link with friends). By designating the quantity, you are limiting how many songs each user can add to your playlist.</p>

<p>After your playlist has been created, start adding songs! As the owner, there is no limit on how many you can add. When you are done, click the Playlist Link and you can view all of your songs on YouTube.</p>
